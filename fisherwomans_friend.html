                <div class = "seven_text">
                   <p>There are many people who enjoy being out in nature, not just for the purpose of fishing. There are likely to be a range of people enjoying the same space. Dogwalkers, cyclists, pedestrians and also people using the water.</p>
                    <p>Be wary of your surroundings, try to keep all your fishing equipment tidy and close to you.</p>
                    <p>When casting out, make sure to keep an eye out for others. Also, you should try not to fish too close to trees, bushes or anything else that your hook or line may get caught in while casting out.</p>
                    <p>Always make sure not to litter. Waste from food, drinks etc, and fishing waste can be a hazard to all wildlife. Used hooks and lines should always be disposed of sensibly. </p>
                    <p>Check the weather and wear appropriate clothing. If it is sunny, you might need a hat and sun cream as UV rays can be reflected off open water, which can lead to an increase in UV exposure.</p>
                    <p>Be careful where you set up. Don't fish too close to the edge, be aware of sloping ground or steep banks, you don't want to fall in!</p>
                    <p>Most of all, enjoy yourself and remember, fishing is fun!</p>
