                    <p>Chorlton Water Park is a Local Nature Reserve and stands on the site of Barlow Hall Farm. During the construction of the M60 motorway in the 1970's, gravel was excavated from the site. The gravel pit was subsequently flooded creating the lake that is central to the Water Park today.</p>

                    <p>Heaton Park is the largest park in Manchester, it is not somewhere that you would necessarily think of as a fishing venue, but there is a well established lake which will provide you with a fun day out. If you plan on heading down for a session, you need to get on the boating lake – it is not possible to fish on any of the other waters. The lake has a pretty good head of carp and is stocked with a wide range of coarse species.</p>
